issues - 
url is changing but home page's content is showing after nested routing - solution is shared layout

by adding <Outlet > to home page --> home page + self page content is showing - solution is remove repeated thing from all other pages but what about home page's data now  

Home page is having common things which will be shown in all the time but we also want its data to be shown 
so we will create onbe component which will contain common data ( basically whatever was present there in the home component)
and now home component will have its separate  data 
Create Route for home like below 
<Route index element={<Home />} />
index - renders into their parents Outlet at their parents URL ( like as default child route )
no path
